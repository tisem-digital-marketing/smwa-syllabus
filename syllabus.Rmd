# Motivation

"Some 73% of online adults now use a social networking site of some kind... [and] 42% of online adults now use multiple social networking sites," according to a recent Pew Research survey.^[
Pew Research, 2019, [Social Media Fact Sheet.](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/)
]
If a business needs to be where its customers are, then establishing a strong presence on social media is a critical component of a modern marketing strategy.
The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of the social media landscape from the point of view of a marketing analyst.
The course content will be unashamedly analytics heavy - utilizing modern statistical and mathematical modelling techniques to deliver managerially relevant conclusions from social media data.
To that end, we need to be able to deliver data-driven answers the following questions:
How does one develop or maintain an online reputation or develop their brand online? 
How does one maintain a strong user community on social networking sites? 
How can one craft a potent social media advertising strategy? 
How does one quantitatively assess whether their online reputation is positive and/or improving, or whether their social marketing is effective?
What are the potential pitfalls in social media- and online- marketing?

<!---
To answer these questions, we must synthesize knowledge from a variety of disciplines. 
Sociologists have researched such concepts as homophily and social capital, which point to the underlying motivations in the relationships of individuals in a social network, 
  computer scientists have uncovered surprising patterns in real-world social networks, 
  and marketing experts have studied how network structure influences consumer demand, what makes ads go 'viral' and aspects of social advertising. 
This course will combine foundational material with examples from the social world to build a data-driven understanding of modern social media marketing.
--->

To answer these questions, the course is split into four substantive modules:

1. **Empirical Analysis of Patterns in Social Networks:** which seeks to describes and explain several common patterns found in real-world social networks,
2. **Analysing Brand Reputation in Online Communities:** which explores the best practice methods for maintaining a strong brand online and managing the user community,
3. **Quantifying the Importance of Influencers and Word of Mouth:** which discusses an individual's place in the network, and how early adoption, word of mouth and other 'information cascades' propagate,
4. **Measuring the Effectiveness of Social Media Advertising:** which focuses on viral marketing and social advertising techniques.

During these modules we will focus on extracting insights from the recent academic literature as well as learning and then leveraging an analytics toolkit comprising linear regression, causal inference, text analytics and social network analysis. 

#  Course Objectives

This course has seven closely intertwined objectives.
After the completion of the course you will be able to:

1. Explain and evaluate the challenges and opportunities social media and social networks present marketers.
2. Summarize state of the art knowledge from the academic marketing literature about social media's impact on marketing.
3. Provide intuitive explanations of statistical concepts from the areas of linear regression, causal inference, natural language processing and network analytics
4. Implement statistical analysis to analyze social media data using tools from linear regression, causal inference, natural language processing and network analytics
5. Interpret their own and other's statistical analysis of social media data
6. Prescribe Managerial and Marketing strategies to improve business performance based on analytical findings.
7. Appraise and critique the assumptions behind statistical analysis of social media data in a given setting and propose alternative methodologies to improve existing analysis  

Learning objectives for specific classes will be provided within the Course Notes.

# Target Audience

This course is designed for students in the Master of Marketing Analytics in order to 
  (i) improve their quantitative and analytical skills, 
  and (ii) gain an understanding of recent developments in our understanding of social media and online marketing.

In particular, we expect the typical student to have the following characteristics:

* Strong interest in understanding how social media and social networks affect consumer behaviour, brand reputation and the actions of marketers.
* Strong interest in learning and applying statistical analysis and data science techniques to social media data, although with limited existing background.
* Strong interest in using quantitative results to develop management or marketing insights.
* Interest in learning how to write computer code and acquire "best practice" methods.
* Interest in learning new quantitative modelling techniques.
* Ability to work collaboratively.

# Position in the (wider) Program

Social Media and Web Analytics is meant to offer Marketing Analytics students an overview of the tools and techniques most frequently used when analysing social media and web data.
These tools are widely adopted across firms (traditional and modern), providing  students an opportunity to develop their quantitative skills in digital marketing should they wish to work as a marketing analyst. 
The course also provides examples of scientific research conducted within the subject domain, helping students build up a state of the art knowledge of the area which can be used in a professional career and/or in future academic study (e.g enrolling in a PhD program).

# Prerequisites

To do well in this course it is suggested that you have passed the course Introduction to Marketing Research.
<!--- Pre-requisite classes can be taken concurrently with this class if needed. --->

In addition, students will benefit from having completed other marketing courses (such as Customer Analytics and Price and Revenue Analytics) and other classes at TiSEM that deal with data and computing (i.e. the 'skills classes').
These are, however, not required.

The class builds upon a basic knowledge of statistics (eg. regression analysis) and statistical coding (descriptive statistics, data visualization and estimating a regression model).
Refresher material for this content is provided as part of the course preparatory material, and salient aspects will be reviewed in computing/analytics lectures.

# Pedagogy

**The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the class online for this academic year.**

The course will involve video lectures, self-guided tutorials, live discussions sessions and hands on assignments. 
The course strives to balance the practical aspects of social media analytics with a theoretical understanding of the concepts and frameworks involved. 
Each topic covered has a lecture/discussion portion as well as a practicum/exercise/demo portion. 
There are course projects in the form of group assignments and an individual final project where you will work on the developing your analytical toolkit and framing results around answering marketing questions.

The course structure takes advantage of an asynchronous format. 
This format lets you work through most of the course material in your own time, and aims to minimizes 'Zoom fatigue'.
Each week, you will be expected to complete the following tasks:

* Read through the required readings
* Watch video lecture clips
* Work through the self-guided analytics tutorial
* Work collaboratively on group assignments (as needed)
* Work individually towards the course project's milestones.

Lecture material will be split into multiple (short) video clips. 
This allows you to work through topics at your own pace, and revisit specific sections multiple times relatively easily.

In addition, there will be a two "live" discussion sections each week, beginning in the second week of the class. 
These sections will run on the Zoom meeting platform, and links will be distributed on the course website.
The format is as follows:

* Each session will last 60 - 75 minutes
* The schedule for discussion sections are available on the course website.
  * The numerous public holidays in Block 4 means that the section times move around week-to-week
* Each session will discuss 2-3 topics, topics *will differ between sessions*
  * Topics covered in week $x$ will be based on week $x-1$'s course material
  * Specific topics will be decided based on surveying student's interests each week, and will be announced in advance
* Instructors will aim to facilitate a discussion between students, rather than instructors leading the discussion
  * Instructors can end a session at their discretion if they feel students are not engaging in the discussion
* Discussion sections will *not* be recorded
* Attendance is optional

Because we are adapting this course to an online format, we reserve the right to change the design or content of these live sessions, depending on our experiences and your feedback.

All the videos, documents and (where appropriate) weblinks will be made available on the course website and via GitHub.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In addition there are weekly, ungraded "Lab Assignments" to help you develop your knowledge around the course content.

**Course Repeaters**: Students repeating Social Media and Web Analytics must submit all assessment pieces to pass the course.
Grades from a previous attempts do not carry over to the current semester.

## Group Technical Assignments (30 percent)

There will be 2 group assignments worth equal weight. 
To pass the assignment, each group member needs to have made a substantial contribution to the project. 
The finished reports (& code where appropriate) must be submitted via GitHub no later than midnight of the due date (i.e. before 23:59 on the due date).

Group assignments **must** be done in groups. 
Students will be **randomly assigned** to groups before each assignment is released and groups for each assignment. 
Each group will consist of 4 students and may include students who are not part of your Lab Section.
<!--- Working with other student's you are unfamiliar with is an important skill to acquire, and mimics aspects of team work in the real world. --->

The topics for the group assignments are:

* Technical Assignment 1: Evaluating & Managing Online Reputation.
    * We will use data from Trip Adviser and some supplementary sources to examine how management responses to review impact online reputation.
    * Main analysis toolkit: Linear Regression & Causal Inference
* Technical Assignment 2: Analyzing Social Media Text.
    * We use publicly available tweets about US airlines to track consumer sentiment and discussion topics.
    * Main analysis toolkit: Natural Language Processing

Further information on technical assignments will be distributed closer to their issue.

## Group Presentations and Panel Discussion (20 percent)

Main Points: 

Max 15 minute presentation
10 Min Q&A from panel 
5 Min Q&A from audience

## Final Exam (50 percent)

## Lab Assignments (Ungraded)


<!---
## Group Formation

This course has two assignments which **must** be done in groups. 
Students will be **randomly assigned** to groups before the each assignment is released, i.e. the groups will change between assignments. 
Each group will consist of 5 students.

Working with other student's you are unfamiliar with is an important skill to acquire, and mimics aspects of team work in the *real world*.
---> 
## Grading Policies 

### Regrade Policy for Technical Assignments

If you believe an error has been made in grading your assignments, you may request a re-grade. 
The request must be in writing, must explain the exact concern, and must occur within 7 calendar days of when the graded materials were returned or when the final course grade is posted. 
I reserve the right to re-grade the entire contents of any submitted assignment. 
This means that your grade may go up or down, depending on what is found during the re-grade.

### Missed Group Presentations

### Late Submission

Technical Assignments must be submitted before the deadline.
Late submissions will be penalized by 25 percent per calendar day.
This penalty applies to an entire group.

# Study Load 

Planning your workload over the semester (even tentatively) can help to alleviate stress and pressure around deadlines and exams.
The table below presents an estimated split of how your study time should be allocated in this class.
We hope this helps you allocate time more efficiently within this class, and when juggling multiple classes.

# Class Technology

## Access to Materials and Assessment

### Canvas

TBD

### GitHub Classroom

I am going to run the course through GitHub Classroom. 
You will receive an email invitation to the course repo with instructions in due time, but for now it suffices to say that this is how we’ll submit assignments and provide feedback, etc.
Canvas will only be used to submit weekly quiz solutions, distribute grades, and registration of teams for group assignments.

## Computing

This course is an analytics course, and as such we aim to use, understand and develop computational routines that help managers and marketers make better decisions.
Large portions of the course will be *'hands-on'* and we will be using the statistical software `R` to demonstrate and apply methods and concepts in class.

All of the software requirements for this course are open-source and/or free. 
Please aim to have everything installed by the start of our first lecture.

*We will be available for installation troubleshooting during the first week of the course.*
*You can sign up for to get installation help via our office hour sign-up links (see below).*

## R & RStudio

You will be required to install `R` and `RStudio` to complete the Labs and group assignments.
Installation instructions are available in the [Installation Guide](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa-installation-guide/) (they differ slightly by operating system):

After installing R and RStudio I suggest you get acquainted with the interface and basic data analysis commands before the first class.
To facilitate the introduction, we've suggested some DataCamp modules for you to work through.
The suggested modules can be found on the [course webpage](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa/) under 'Course Preparation'.
Please look over these *before* the first class.

## Improving Reproduciblity of our Analysis with Git and GitHub

In addition to helping you gain analytics skills using `R`, I want to help you improve the reproducibility of your computational analysis - i.e. I want you to document your code and the changes you make to it.
To help achieve this goal we will use a version control software called `Git` and we will post our codes on a repository called `GitHub`.

* To install Git and create a Github account, follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa-installation-guide/).
* Also register for an education discount to get unlimited private repositories [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).^[
  GitHub recently [announced](https://blog.github.com/changelog/2019-01-08-pricing-changes/) unlimited free private repos for everyone. 
  However, you are limited to three collaborators per private repo, so the education discount still makes sense.
  ]

As part of your preparation for the class, look over the DataCamp modules on "Version Control with Git" that we have highlighted on the [course webpage](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa/) under 'Course Preparation'.
Please look over the material *before* the first class.

# Course Communication

TBD

# Rules of the Game

I have clear expectations of how we should all interact in class and in meetings.
They are summarized by the "7 Be's" below:

## Be Active

Learning via passive listening is an ineffective learning technique.
Come to discussion classes prepared to ask questions, and to answer questions posed by me and others in class.
This will lead to a much more enjoyable learning experience for us all.
I would much rather have an engaging discussion on topics where we share mutual interest and cover less material than have Discussion Sections become a monologue.

## Be "Hands-on"
The class is designed to be `hands-on' in the sense that you will be expected to complete a substantial amount of coding exercises.
We strongly believe the only way to learn programming is to do programming.
Try to complete each 'Lab Session' be prepared to ask and answer questions about it during Discussion Sections.
Codes that solve exercises will be posted *after* Discussion Sections.

## Be Prepared

We expect you to dedicate an average of 20 hours per week of study time to this course.
Use this time to look over required readings, re-examine course notes and codes and work on your assignments.
Looking over required readings means that our discussions will have more substance, and (ideally) be more insightful.

Quick tip: If you find yourself not understanding part of the course content or not able to find bugs in your code, take a break and come back to it in an hour or so. 
Come talk to us if it remains unclear.

## Be Professional

I expect you to treat us and your class members collegially.
In addition, we have a set of [Social Rules](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa/social_rules/) and a [Code of Conduct](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa/conduct/) that provides further details of acceptable and unacceptable behavior.

When writing an email, being professional also means using a meaningful subject line, identifying yourself (i.e. Regards, Lachlan at the end of the email), and keeping the message focused.
We aim to reply to emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday, but there might be a slight delay if you write to us late Friday evening. 

I strongly encourage you to provide feedback about both format and content during the course.
We will provide survey links to collect this feedback at regular intervals.
Be professional when filling these out.

## Be Informal (but not too informal!)

Do not address us with "Mr.", "Dr.", or "Prof.". 
Please use our first name's (i.e. Lachlan and Hendrik). 
More formality than that makes me feel uncomfortable.

Also you can to add us on LinkedIn or Twitter - where we maintain professional accounts, but not Facebook.

## Be International

This course is taught in English.
You are obliged to speak English whenever there are international students present and all Slack messages on public channels must be in English. 
If in doubt, you need to communicate in English.
As someone who has studied in in countries where I do not speak the native language - be assured it is *very much appreciated.*

## Be Healthy (Physically & Mentally)

Physical and Mental health are important, and definitely more important than your coursework.
Material posted online, the readings and talking with your classmates about what you missed is more than enough if you miss one or two classes.

On the mental health side, I know how challenging graduate study can be, especially when paired with one's 'non-study life.'
*I strongly encourage you to prioritize mental health over **everything** else.*
I'm happy to talk with you individually and share some common experiences and strategies, but I am not a professional. 
If you feel like you need to talk to someone, a good starting point might be [Tilburg's Education Coordinators](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/tutoring/education-coordinators/economics-management) or the [student psychologists](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/tutoring/psychologist) at the University.

## Be Fair & Honorable 

In group assignments we expect all group members to actively and evenly contribute.
If you are struggling with parts of a group assignment you are working on, talk to your group members and to us rather than withdrawing from conversations with your colleagues. 

Being fair & honorable also means that you should not plagiarize others work.
We stick closely with the School's Fraud and plagiarism policies which are outlined [here](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/regulations/fraud/economics).

# The Tilburg University Code of Conduct

Tilburg University has a Code of Conduct that all employees and students of Tilburg University are expected to follow. 
Please read the \href{https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/conduct-and-integrity/code-conduct}{Code of Conduct} from Tilburg University.

Social Media and Web Analytics' own Code of Conduct, Social Rules and 8 Be's are designed to encompass principles within this code, but where differences may occur are super-seeded by Tilburg's own Code of Conduct. 

# Academic Integrity @ Tilburg U

Cheating, plagiarism, and/or doing work for another person who will receive academic credit are all impermissible. 
This includes the use of unauthorized books, notebooks, or other sources in order to secure or give help for an assignment or the presentation of unacknowledged material as if it were the student's own work. 
Having unauthorized notes at your exam, cribbing from a fellow student, manipulating results and copying text from others without references are examples of fraud. Once fraud is suspected, the Examination Board will be informed accordingly. 
Please refer to the \href{https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/conduct-and-integrity}{website} for more information.

# FAQs

**R looks cool, but I’m more familiar with Python/Julia/MatLab/SPSS/etc. Can I use that instead?**

Short answer: No. 

Longer answer: Look, I like and use a lot of those languages too, but I’m not changing
my lecture notes or assignment templates for you. 
Plus, I really do think that R makes the most sense for quantitative marketing students looking to develop their data science skills. 
It already has all of the statistics and econometrics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other programming languages and APIs. 
Learning multiple languages is never a bad idea in the long run, though.

**I already have a BitBucket/GitLab/etc. account. Do I still have to use GitHub?**

Since I’m running this course through GitHub Classroom, yes. But good for you! (Seriously... those are great platforms too and as an open-source advocate, I fully support a plurality of tools and software options.)

**On that note, do you have any advice for running a course on GitHub Classroom?**

I mostly followed [this excellent tutorial](https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-teachers) by Jacob Fiksel.
(Hat Tip to Grant McDermott at U Oregon for recommending this!)

**This course looks interesting! Can I use/adapt your lecture notes for a similar course that I’m teaching at XYZ?**

Sure. 
I’ve benefited greatly from other people making their teaching materials publicly available (and have tried my best to acknowledge them directly in the relevant sections of this course). 
I’m more than happy to pay it forward.
I only ask two small favours. 
1) Please let me know (email/Twitter) if you do use material from this course, or have found it useful in other ways. 
2) A minor acknowledgment somewhere in your own syllabus or notes would be much appreciated.
