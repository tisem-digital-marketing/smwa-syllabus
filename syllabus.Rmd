# Motivation

"Some 73% of online adults now use a social networking site of some kind... [and] 42% of online adults now use multiple social networking sites," according to a recent Pew Research survey.
If a business needs to be where its customers are, then it clearly needs to establish a strong
presence on social media, but how does one develop an online reputation or develop their brand
online? 
How does one maintain a strong user community on social networking sites? 
How can one craft a potent social advertising strategy? 
What are the potential pitfalls?
To answer these, we must synthesize knowledge from a variety of disciplines. 
While sociologists have researched such concepts as homophily and social capital, which point to the underlying motivations in the relationships of individuals in a network, computer scientists
have uncovered surprising patterns in real-world social networks, and marketing experts have
studied viral marketing and social advertising. 
This course will combine such foundational material with actual case studies of businesses in the social world.

The course is split into four main parts:

1. **Network Patterns:** which describes and seeks to explain several common patterns found in real-world social networks,
2. **Branding and Community:** which explores the best methods for maintaining a strong brand online and managing the user community,
3. **Importance and Influence:** which discusses an individualâ€™s place in the network, and how memes, early adoption, and such 'information cascades' propagate,
4. **Advertising and Marketing:** which focuses on viral marketing and social advertising techniques.

## Class Participation

## Homework Assignments 

## Course Project

## Group Formation

## Regrade Policy

If you believe an error has been made in grading your assignments, you may request a re-grade. 
The request must be in writing, must explain the exact concern, and must occur within 7 calendar days of when the graded materials were returned or when the final course grade is posted. 
I reserve the right to re-grade the entire contents of any submitted assignment. 
This means that your grade may go up or down, depending on what is found during the re-grade.

## Late Submission

Assignments and Projects must be submitted before the deadline unless I grant an extraordinary written exception.
If you submit one assignment late, you will be penalized by 25 percent per calendar day.
This penalty applies to an entire group where applicable.
After the first late submission, you will get zero points on all subsequent late submissions

# Rules of the Game

The class is designed to be `hands-on' in the sense that you will be programming a lot of things *during the class*.
We strongly believe the only way to learn programming is to do programming.
Please bring your laptop with you to each session and install the required software before the course begins.
Try to complete each activity we do in class and be prepared to ask and answer questions during class.
Slides or notes will be made available at the beginning of each day, codes that solve exercises will be posted during or after the session.

# Office Hours

# Preliminary Schedule

The following is a preliminary schedule.
It may be updated prior to the beginning of the course, and updated schedule will be forwarded before the course begins.
