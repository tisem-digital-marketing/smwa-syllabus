# Motivation

"Some 73% of online adults now use a social networking site of some kind... [and] 42% of online adults now use multiple social networking sites," according to a recent Pew Research survey.
If a business needs to be where its customers are, then it clearly needs to establish a strong
presence on social media, but how does one develop an online reputation or develop their brand
online? 
How does one maintain a strong user community on social networking sites? 
How can one craft a potent social advertising strategy? 
What are the potential pitfalls?
To answer these, we must synthesize knowledge from a variety of disciplines. 
While sociologists have researched such concepts as homophily and social capital, which point to the underlying motivations in the relationships of individuals in a network, computer scientists
have uncovered surprising patterns in real-world social networks, and marketing experts have
studied viral marketing and social advertising. 
This course will combine such foundational material with actual case studies of businesses in the social world.

The course is split into four main parts:

1. **Network Patterns:** which describes and seeks to explain several common patterns found in real-world social networks,
2. **Branding and Community:** which explores the best methods for maintaining a strong brand online and managing the user community,
3. **Importance and Influence:** which discusses an individual’s place in the network, and how memes, early adoption, and such 'information cascades' propagate,
4. **Advertising and Marketing:** which focuses on viral marketing and social advertising techniques.

# Target Audience

#  Course Objectives

This course has XX closely intertwined objectives:


Learning objectives for specific modules will be provided within the Course Notes.

# Pedagogy

The course will involve lectures and discussions, web videos, hands on in-class assignments. 
The course strives to balance the practical aspects of social media analytics with a theoretical understanding of the concepts and frameworks involved. 
Each topic covered has a lecture/discussion portion as well as a practicum/exercise/demo portion (called Labs below). 
We include video clips that are designed to introduce you to technical aspects of statistical analysis and computational modelling so that we can focus on marketing substance in lectures.
There are course projects in the form of group assignments and an individual final project where we will work on the developing our analytical toolkit and framing results around answering marketing questions.

# Pre-requisites

This course has one pre-requisite - XXXX Introduction to Marketing Research.
Pre-requisite classes can be taken concurrently with this class if needed.

In addition, students will benefit from having completed other marketing courses (Examples) and other classes at TiSEM that deal with data and computing (i.e. the 'skills classes').
These are, however, not required.

# Computing

This course is an applied course, and as such we aim to use, understand and develop computational routines that help managers and marketers make better decisions.
Large portions of the course will be *'hands-on'* and we wil be using the statistical software `R` to demonstrate and apply methods and concepts in class.

All of the software requirements for this course are open-source and/or free. 
Please aim to have everything installed by the start of our first lecture.

*I will be available for installation troubleshooting during the first week of the course.*
*You can sign up for a slot to get installation help [here](TODO:link-to-be-created.com)*

## R & RStudio

You will be required to install `R` and `RStudio` to complete the Labs and group assignments.
Installation instructions are available from the links below (they differ slightly by operating system):

* [Installing `R`](TODO:link-to-be-created.com)
* [Installing RStudio](TODO:link-to-be-created.com)

After installing R and RStudio I suggest you get acquainted with the interface and basic data analysis commands before the first class.
To facilitate the introduction, there are a series of introductory videos and a quiz to test your understanding available on the [course webpage](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).
Please look over these before the first class.

## Improving Reproduciblity of our Analysis 

In addition to helping you gain analytics skills using `R`, I want to help you improve the reproducibility of your computational analysis - i.e. I want (i) you to document your code and the changes you make to it, and (ii) your code to be able to run on not only your computer, but mine and anyone else's.
To help achieve this goal we will use a version control software called `Git` and we will post our codes on a repository called `GitHub`.

* To install Git and create a Github account, follow [these instructions]().
* Also regsiter for an education discount to get unlimited private repositories [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).^[
  GitHub recently [announced](https://blog.github.com/changelog/2019-01-08-pricing-changes/) unlimited free private repos for everyone. 
  However, you are limited to three collaborators per private repo, so the education discount still makes sense.
  ]

An introductory tutorial in video format and a quiz to test your understanding are available on the [course website](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).
Please look over the material before the first class.

### GitHub Classroom

I am going to run the entire course through GitHub Classroom. 
You will receive an email invitation to the course repo with instructions in due time, but for now it suffices to saythat this is how we’ll submit assignments, provide feedback, receive grades, etc.

# Evaluation

## Class Participation (5 percent)

Attendance and participation in class is required. 
There will be a set of randomly announced in-class recap quizzes (don't worry you cant fail these) that will be graded on a check/check+ basis. 
If you are not in class you will receive no grade for this quiz. 
There will be four/five such quizzes and I will take the best three to determine your score in addition to a subjective evaluation of your participation in class. 
There is absolutely no make up for these quizzes.

## Homework Assignments (40 percent)

There will be 2 group assignments worth equal weight. 
To pass the assignment, each group member needs to have made a substantial contribution to the project. 
For the second assignment (where you will advertise for a client on Facebook), funds will be provided but you must find the business whose Facebook page you will promote. 
The finished reports (& code where appropriate) must be submitted via GitHub no later than midnight the day of the class (i.e. before 23:59 the day before a class).

Further information on group assignments will be distributed closer to their issue.

## Course Project (55 percent)

You  must develop a project on any topic related to social media analytics that interests you. 
The final submission of the report has three features: (1) a written report of a max. 8 pages, (2) the underlying code & data to produce the report and (3) a 4 minute video presentation of your research.

The project should have the following characteristics:

* There should be a clear motivation. You should be trying to solve a question that matters, either to society or business.
* You should do a thorough survey of the relevant literature. This includes articles from the popular press as well as from scholarly sources such as academic journals.
* Your report and presentation should organize this literature survey appropriately, and summarize your main insights and findings.

## Group Formation

This course has two assignments which **must** be done in groups. 
Students will be **randomly assigned** to groups before the each assignment is released. 
Each group will consist of 5 students.

Working with other student's you are unfamiliar with is an important skill to acquire, and mimics aspects of team work in the `real world`.

## Regrade Policy

If you believe an error has been made in grading your assignments, you may request a re-grade. 
The request must be in writing, must explain the exact concern, and must occur within 7 calendar days of when the graded materials were returned or when the final course grade is posted. 
I reserve the right to re-grade the entire contents of any submitted assignment. 
This means that your grade may go up or down, depending on what is found during the re-grade.

## Late Submission

Assignments and Projects must be submitted before the deadline unless I grant an extraordinary written exception.
If you submit one assignment late, you will be penalized by 25 percent per calendar day.
This penalty applies to an entire group where applicable.
After the first late submission, you will get zero points on all subsequent late submissions

# Rules of the Game

The class is designed to be `hands-on' in the sense that you will be programming a lot of things *during the class*.
We strongly believe the only way to learn programming is to do programming.
Please bring your laptop with you to each session and install the required software before the course begins.
Try to complete each activity we do in class and be prepared to ask and answer questions during class.
Slides or notes will be made available at the beginning of each day, codes that solve exercises will be posted during or after the session.

# Office Hours

# Preliminary Schedule

The following is a preliminary schedule.
It may be updated prior to the beginning of the course, and updated schedule will be forwarded before the course begins.
