# Motivation

"Some 73% of online adults now use a social networking site of some kind... [and] 42% of online adults now use multiple social networking sites," according to a recent Pew Research survey.^[
Pew Research, 2019, [Social Media Fact Sheet.](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/)
]
If a business needs to be where its customers are, then establishing a strong presence on social media is a critical component of a modern marketing strategy.
The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of the social media landscape from the point of view of a marketing analyst.
To that end, we need to be able to answer the following questions:
How does one develop an online reputation or develop their brand online? 
How does one maintain a strong user community on social networking sites? 
How can one craft a potent social advertising strategy? 
What are the potential pitfalls?
How does one quantitatively assess whether their online reputation is positive and/or improving, or whether their social marketing is effective?

To answer these questions, we must synthesize knowledge from a variety of disciplines. 
Sociologists have researched such concepts as homophily and social capital, which point to the underlying motivations in the relationships of individuals in a social network, 
  computer scientists have uncovered surprising patterns in real-world social networks, 
  and marketing experts have studied how network structure influences consumer demand, what makes ads go 'viral' and aspects of social advertising. 
This course will combine this foundational material with actual case studies of businesses in the social world to build an understanding of modern social media marketing.
As we progress through the course a heavy emphasis on analytical techniques - both statistical and theoretical - will guide our understanding and allow us to draw conclusions from data to answer the questions posed above.

The course is split into four modules:

1. **Network Patterns:** which seeks to describes and explain several common patterns found in real-world social networks,
2. **Branding and Community:** which explores the best practice methods for maintaining a strong brand online and managing the user community,
3. **Importance and Influence:** which discusses an individual's place in the network, and how memes, early adoption, word of mouth and other 'information cascades' propagate,
4. **Advertising and Marketing:** which focuses on viral marketing and social advertising techniques.

# Target Audience

This course is designed for students in the Master of Marketing Analytics and Master of Marketing Management who have a strong interest in social media marketing and 
  want to improve their quantitative and analytical skills.

In particular, I expect the typical student to have the following characteristics:

* Strong interest in understanding how social media and social networks effect consumer behaviour, brand reputation and the actions of marketers.
* Strong interest in learning and applying statistical analysis and data science techniques to social media data, although with limited existing background (see Pre-reqs below).
* Strong interest in using quantitative results to develop management or marketing insights.
* Interest in learning how to write computer code and acquire "best practice" methods.
* Interest in learning new quantitative modelling techniques.
* Ability to work collaboratively.

#  Course Objectives

This course has five closely intertwined objectives:

1. Develop awareness of the challenges and opportunities social media and social networks present marketers.
2. Learning to use quantitative and statistical analysis to develop strategies for managers and marketers on social media platforms.
3. Understanding which modelling or statistical technique is best suited to a particular problem.
4. Develop the ability to understand the limitations of one's analyisis.
5. Acquire neccesary skills to work collaboratively in teams on analytical marketing problems.

Learning objectives for specific modules will be provided within the Course Notes.

# Pedagogy

The course will involve lectures and discussions, web videos, hands on in-class assignments. 
The course strives to balance the practical aspects of social media analytics with a theoretical understanding of the concepts and frameworks involved. 
Each topic covered has a lecture/discussion portion as well as a practicum/exercise/demo portion (called Labs below). 
We include video clips that are designed to introduce you to technical aspects of statistical analysis and computational modelling so that we can focus on marketing substance in lectures.
There are course projects in the form of group assignments and an individual final project where we will work on the developing our analytical toolkit and framing results around answering marketing questions.

# Pre-requisites

This course has one pre-requisite - Introduction to Marketing Research.
Pre-requisite classes can be taken concurrently with this class if needed.

In addition, students will benefit from having completed other marketing courses (Examples) and other classes at TiSEM that deal with data and computing (i.e. the 'skills classes').
These are, however, not required.

# Computing

This course is an applied course, and as such we aim to use, understand and develop computational routines that help managers and marketers make better decisions.
Large portions of the course will be *'hands-on'* and we wil be using the statistical software `R` to demonstrate and apply methods and concepts in class.

All of the software requirements for this course are open-source and/or free. 
Please aim to have everything installed by the start of our first lecture.

*I will be available for installation troubleshooting during the first week of the course.*
*You can sign up for a slot to get installation help [here](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).*

## R & RStudio

You will be required to install `R` and `RStudio` to complete the Labs and group assignments.
Installation instructions are available from the links below (they differ slightly by operating system):

* [Installing `R`](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).
* [Installing RStudio](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).

After installing R and RStudio I suggest you get acquainted with the interface and basic data analysis commands before the first class.
To facilitate the introduction, there are a series of introductory videos and a quiz to test your understanding available on the [course webpage](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).
Please look over these before the first class.

## Improving Reproduciblity of our Analysis 

In addition to helping you gain analytics skills using `R`, I want to help you improve the reproducibility of your computational analysis - i.e. I want (i) you to document your code and the changes you make to it, and (ii) your code to be able to run on not only your computer, but mine and anyone else's.
To help achieve this goal we will use a version control software called `Git` and we will post our codes on a repository called `GitHub`.

* To install Git and create a Github account, follow [these instructions](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).
* Also regsiter for an education discount to get unlimited private repositories [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).^[
  GitHub recently [announced](https://blog.github.com/changelog/2019-01-08-pricing-changes/) unlimited free private repos for everyone. 
  However, you are limited to three collaborators per private repo, so the education discount still makes sense.
  ]

An introductory tutorial in video format and a quiz to test your understanding are available on the [course website](TODO:link-to-be-created.com).
Please look over the material before the first class.

### GitHub Classroom

I am going to run the entire course through GitHub Classroom. 
You will receive an email invitation to the course repo with instructions in due time, but for now it suffices to saythat this is how weâ€™ll submit assignments, provide feedback, receive grades, etc.

# Evaluation

## Class Participation (5 percent)

Attendance and participation in class is required. 
There will be a set of randomly announced in-class recap quizzes (don't worry you cant fail these) that will be graded on a check/check+ basis. 
If you are not in class you will receive no grade for this quiz. 
There will be four/five such quizzes and I will take the best three to determine your score in addition to a subjective evaluation of your participation in class. 
There is absolutely no make up for these quizzes.

## Homework Assignments (40 percent)

There will be 2 group assignments worth equal weight. 
To pass the assignment, each group member needs to have made a substantial contribution to the project. 
The finished reports (& code where appropriate) must be submitted via GitHub no later than midnight the day of the class (i.e. before 23:59 the day before a class).

The topics for the group assignments are:

* Group Assignment 1: Evaluating & Managing Online Reputation.
    * We will use data from Trip Adviser and some supplementary sources.
* Group Assignment 2: Advertising on Facebook & Analysing Facebook Ads.
    * We use publicly available data provided by Facebook to explore advertising effectiveness on their platform.

Further information on group assignments will be distributed closer to their issue.

## Course Project (55 percent)

You  must develop a project on any topic related to social media analytics that interests you. 
The final submission of the report has three features: 
  (1) a written report of a max. 10 pages, 
  (2) the underlying code & data to produce the report, and 
  (3) a 5 minute video presentation of your research.

The project should have the following characteristics:

* There should be a clear motivation. You should be trying to solve a question that matters, either to society or business.
* You should do a thorough survey of the relevant literature. This includes articles from the popular press as well as from scholarly sources such as academic journals.
* Your report and video presentation should organize this literature survey appropriately, and summarize your main insights and findings.

To assist you design your project with these characteristics, I have broken the project into three components: (1) proposal, (2) literature review, and (3) a report and video. 
Each component has different due dates *and* contributes to your final grade.

The final grade for your project is computed as:

$$\textrm{Project Grade} = 0.25 \times \textrm{Proposal} 
                         + 0.15 \times \textrm{Literature Review}
                         + 0.60 \times \left( \textrm{Report + Video} \right)
                        $$

## Group Formation

This course has two assignments which **must** be done in groups. 
Students will be **randomly assigned** to groups before the each assignment is released. 
Each group will consist of 5 students.

Working with other student's you are unfamiliar with is an important skill to acquire, and mimics aspects of team work in the *real world*.

## Regrade Policy

If you believe an error has been made in grading your assignments, you may request a re-grade. 
The request must be in writing, must explain the exact concern, and must occur within 7 calendar days of when the graded materials were returned or when the final course grade is posted. 
I reserve the right to re-grade the entire contents of any submitted assignment. 
This means that your grade may go up or down, depending on what is found during the re-grade.

## Late Submission

Assignments and Projects must be submitted before the deadline unless I grant an extraordinary written exception.
If you submit one assignment late, you will be penalized by 25 percent per calendar day.
This penalty applies to an entire group where applicable.
After the first late submission, you will get zero points on all subsequent late submissions

# Rules of the Game

The class is designed to be `hands-on' in the sense that you will be programming a lot of things *during the class*.
We strongly believe the only way to learn programming is to do programming.
Please bring your laptop with you to each session and install the required software before the course begins.
Try to complete each activity we do in class and be prepared to ask and answer questions during class.
Slides or notes will be made available at the beginning of each day, codes that solve exercises will be posted during or after the session.

# Office Hours

# Preliminary Schedule
